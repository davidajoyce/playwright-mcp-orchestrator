# Test the connection
claude mcp get playwright-orchestrator
```

## After Setup

1. **Restart Claude Code**
2. **Test in chat:**
   ```
   Create a new browser instance and navigate to google.com
   ```

## What You'll Get

- âœ… **6 orchestrator management tools**
- âœ… **21 browser automation tools** per instance
- âœ… **Transparent proxy** - same responses as direct Playwright MCP
- âœ… **Multiple concurrent browser sessions**
- âœ… **Automatic Docker container management**

## Example Usage

```
Hey Claude, use the Playwright orchestrator to:
1. Create a new browser instance
2. Navigate to github.com
3. Search for "playwright"
4. Take a screenshot of the results
5. Clean up the browser instance when done
```

Claude Code will orchestrate all these steps automatically using the MCP tools! ðŸŽ­
